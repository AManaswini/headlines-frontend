You have the right to withdraw your consent or discontinue participation at any time for any reason. Your decision to withdraw will not involve any penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.\nAs with all research, there is a chance that confidentiality of the information we collect from you could be breached – we will take steps to minimize this risk, as discussed in more detail below in this form.\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                    <b>What are the possible benefits for me or others?</b> The potential benefit of the study is a better scientific understanding of the psychological underpinnings that govern understanding of decision making. Besides this, you are not likely to have any direct benefit from being in this research study. This study is designed to learn more about people’s ways of thinking.\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                    <b>How much will I be compensated?</b> You will receive the amount listed on study description which is approximately US$12 / hour.

To ensure the confidentiality of your participation in this study, your consent on this form will be linked to your online ID and never to your name or other identifying information. Your online ID (e.g. Prolific ID) may be used to distribute payment to you. To minimize the risks to confidentiality, we will store our survey responses in secure servers. All data collected will be analyzed in aggregate form.\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                    We may share the data we collect from you for use in future research studies or with other researchers or online platforms (e.g., OSF, GitHub) – if we share the data that we collect about you, we will remove any information that could identify you before we share it.\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                    <b>Who can I contact if I have questions or concerns about this research study?</b>\n                    </span>\n                    <span>\n                    If you have questions, you are free to ask them now.
